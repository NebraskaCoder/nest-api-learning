# Nest API Learning
A repository for me to learn Nest.js. There is no plan at this moment except for me to practice with Nest.js. I may create a both a Nest.js library and Node.js module that is included here soon.

## Developer Environment
I have included a devcontainer that set's up the environment. Specifics will be explained here as time allows.
