# Nest API Learning

A repository for me to learn Nest.js. There is no plan at this moment except for me to practice with Nest.js. I may create a both a Nest.js library and Node.js module that is included here soon.

## Developer Environment

I have included a devcontainer that set's up the environment. Specifics will be explained here as time allows.

## Branches

For now, there are two branches. The [develop](https://github.com/NebraskaCoder/nest-api-learning/tree/develop) branch will house all of my code in development (as you would expect) and [main](https://github.com/NebraskaCoder/nest-api-learning/tree/main) is my "production" branch that should have all my tested code.

`Feature/**` branches will be used as needed but not guarenteed.
